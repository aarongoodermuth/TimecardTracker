TimecardTracker
================

Provides a web interface for "punching in" and "punching out" and logs how much time has yet to be worked

Note
===============

This is not the best impementation. A better implementation would iclude a database.
I also have several additional ideas for this that include:
  -- multiple user support
  -- multiple projects for a user
  -- more configurability
  -- more helpful log info
  -- more than just a web interface (mobile)

In the meantime, anyone is free to use this code and free to make their own modifications and improvements.
