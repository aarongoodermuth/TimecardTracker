TimecardTracker
================

Provides a web interface for "punching in" and "punching out" and logs how much time has yet to be worked

Note
===============

This is currently one of the worst possible implementations imaginable. 
This was all done overnight to get something off the ground that I needed for that week. 
There are several things I want to do to improve this, but I have other projects that require more attention
and this currently suits my needs. I will update when I get a chance. 

In the meantime, anyone is free to use this code and free to make their own modifications and improvements.
